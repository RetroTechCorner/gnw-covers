# gnw-covers
A small and simple script to generate covers for Game&amp;Watch / retro-go

Get your covers from https://github.com/ducalex/retro-go-covers

Adjust the two directories to match your setup:
```
roms_dir="/home/adam/game-and-watch/game-and-watch-retro-go/roms"
covers_dir="/home/adam/game-and-watch/retro-go-covers"
```

Usage: make_covers.sh <col|doom|gb|gbc|gg|lnx|nes|pce|sms>
